# OneClassClassification
One class image classification with pytorch.

There are images which have one of three categories (bags, sneakers or speakers) and images without category. My aim is to build classifier that will determine the presence or absence of a category. 

I suggest use ResNet50 like image feature extractor and then use OneClassSVM algorithm.
